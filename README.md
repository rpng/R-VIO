# R-VIO

R-VIO is an efficient, lightweight, **robocentric visual-inertial odometry** algorithm for consistent 3D motion tracking using only a monocular camera and a 6-axis IMU. Different from standard world-centric VINS algorithms which directly estimate absolute motion of the sensing platform with respect to a fixed, gravity-aligned global frame of reference {G}, R-VIO estimates the relative motion of higher accuracy with respect to a moving local frame {R} (for example, IMU frame) and updates the global pose (orientation and position) estimate through composition. This algorithm is developed with the robocentric sliding-window filtering-based VIO framework that we originally proposed in our *IROS2018* paper and further extended in our recent *IJRR* paper:

## 1. Prerequisites

We have tested the code under Ubuntu **16.04** and ROS **Kinetic**.

### ROS
Download and install instructions can be found at: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu.

Additional ROS packages needed: tf, sensor_msgs, geometry_msgs, nav_msgs, cv_bridge, eigen_conversions.

### Eigen
Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

### OpenCV
Download and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 2.4.3**. **Tested with 2.4.11 and 3.3.1**.

## 2. Build and Run
First, `git clone` the repository and `catkin_make` it. Then, to run `rvio` with single camera/IMU inputs from the ROS topics `/camera/image_raw` and `/imu`, a config file in *config* folder and the corresponding launch file in *launch* folder (for example, `rvio_euroc.yaml` and `euroc.launch` are for [EuRoC](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) dataset) are needed, and to visualize the outputs of R-VIO please use `rviz` with the settings file `rvio_rviz.rviz` in *config* folder. Using the launch file `euroc.launch` will run both R-VIO and rviz for you:

```
Terminal 1: roslaunch rvio euroc.launch
```
```
Terminal 2: rosbag play --pause V1_01_easy.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/image_raw /imu0:=/imu
```

You can also run R-VIO with your own sensor (data) by creating a config file `rvio_NAME_OF_YOUR_DATA.yaml` in *config* folder and the corresponding launch file `NAME_OF_YOUR_DATA.launch` in *launch* folder referring to the above EuRoC example.
